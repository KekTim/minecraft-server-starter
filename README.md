<h1>External Minecraft Server Starter</h1>
<p>With this program you can let a discord bot run on a raspberry pi and then start a more powerful PC through wake on lan. On this other PC the minecraft server automatically gets started and opens a websocket which the discord bot can use to stop the server.</p>

<p>This might not be realy usefull considering you could just rent a server but it was a fun project todo.</p>
